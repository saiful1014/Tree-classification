# Bangladeshi Tree Species Classification

## Overview

This project aims to create a tree species classification system for Bangladeshi trees using deep learning techniques and the Hugging Face transformer models. It involves collecting a diverse dataset of tree images and training a transformer model to classify these trees.

## Project Features

- Collect a comprehensive dataset of images featuring different Bangladeshi tree species.
- Utilize Hugging Face transformer models for efficient and accurate tree classification.
- Train and fine-tune the model for optimal classification performance.
